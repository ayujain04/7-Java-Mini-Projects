# 7-java-mini-projects
7 projects I built over a 3 month period to refine my Data Structures and Algorithms skills in Java

Total Hours: 50

About each project:

p0-person - Would search for people near you that were taking the same class as you. (would return people on the same floor and people in the same building). For example, when run by a tester this is what it returned:

p1-nbody - Used physics to calculate the planets orbit around the sun. Then outputted an image of the planets orbitting around the sun in a way that was factually accurate. 

p2-markov - Created a Markov model for generating random text that looks similar to the training text. By generating one radnom word at a time, the model generated and predicted what the next word would be using probability.

p3-dna - Created a DNA splicer and experimented with the different implementations of a simulated restriction enzym cutting (or cleaving) of a DNA molecule. Purpose was to use a linked list data structure in a real world application. 

p4-autocomplete - Built out an algorithm for the autocomplete feature that is commonly found in many different software applications. 

p5-huffman - Implemented a huffman tree for encoding a text document. Huffman coding is used anywhere from zipping a folder to jpeg and mp3 encodings. 

p6-route - Used Djikstras, BFS, and DFS algorithms behind the scenes to create the image below. Given any graph and any map (image) correlating to that graph, I coded an algorithm that can find the shortest path between 2 points that the user inputs with any amount of stops they desire. GraphDemo.java in this folder is set up to work on the map of the U.S.A that is stored in the project's data and image folder.
